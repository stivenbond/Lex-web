This is a checklist — pure prose/list output, no need for a docx. Let me put together a comprehensive, well-reasoned sequential list based on everything I know about Lex.
The sequence follows a few rules: foundational layers before dependent modules, load-bearing SharedKernel pieces before anything that consumes them, write-path before read-path, and simpler modules before complex ones (so you build confidence and patterns early).

Lex — Sequential Implementation Checklist
Phase 0 — Foundation (nothing works without this)
	∙	Finalize and write ADR-013 (object storage dual-provider design: PostgreSQL bytea + Garage, metadata model, auth model, migration path)
	∙	Stabilize BlockContent model in SharedKernel — define the base block types (text, image, embedded diagram, custom block), versioning strategy, and serialization contract before any module consumes it
	∙	Define Result<T> and Error types in SharedKernel with all error categories (NotFound, Validation, Forbidden, Conflict, Infrastructure)
	∙	Define IDomainEvent base interface and event envelope (correlation ID, timestamp, source module) in SharedKernel
	∙	Define ICurrentUser service interface in SharedKernel (userId, roles, tenantId)
	∙	Write IObjectStorageService / IFileStorageService adapter interfaces in SharedKernel per ADR-002
	∙	Implement PostgreSQL bytea storage provider in ObjectStorage module infrastructure
	∙	Implement Garage (S3-compatible) storage provider in ObjectStorage module infrastructure, behind the same adapter interface
	∙	Write file_records metadata table migration and repository in ObjectStorage module (provider-agnostic)
	∙	Implement FileController streaming endpoint — all file access mediated through API with permission check before byte delivery
	∙	Write architecture tests covering all project reference rules from the architecture reference (this enforces the boundary rules on every CI run going forward)

Phase 1 — Auth & Identity wiring
	∙	Write spec for Keycloak realm bootstrap — default realm JSON, client config, roles (Teacher, Admin, Student), claim mappings
	∙	Define permission constants structure convention (one static class per module’s Core project)
	∙	Spec and implement ICurrentUser concrete implementation reading from JWT claims in YourApp.Infrastructure
	∙	Spec role-to-policy mapping in YourApp.Infrastructure (which roles map to which ASP.NET Core policy names)
	∙	Write install.sh Keycloak bootstrap step spec — what the script must configure automatically on first run

Phase 2 — Scheduling module (foundational, everything references it)
Scheduling is load-bearing because DiaryManagement, LessonManagement, and AssessmentDelivery all depend on the concept of a scheduled period/slot.
	∙	Spec Scheduling domain model — Period, Slot, Class, Classroom, AcademicYear, Term entities and their relationships

	∙	Spec queries: GetSessionForStudent, GetSubmissionById, GetSessionResults
	∙	Spec published events: AssessmentSubmittedEvent, AssessmentGradedEvent

Phase 8 — Notifications module (cross-cutting)
	∙	Spec Notification domain model — Notification, NotificationChannel (in-app, email), NotificationTemplate, DeliveryStatus
	∙	Spec which domain events trigger notifications and what each notification says — map every *Event already specced to zero or more notification rules

	∙	Spec queries: all report/dashboard query handlers (read from reporting.* schema only)
	∙	Define Reporting database schema (reporting.*) and initial migration
	∙	Spec Reporting API surface
	∙	Spec Reporting frontend views — dashboard cards, summary tables, charts (if any)

Phase 10 — GoogleIntegration module

	∙	Spec Drive import/export — what can be imported from Drive (lesson resources, assessment files) and exported to Drive
	∙	Spec published events: GoogleSyncCompletedEvent, GoogleImportCompletedEvent
	∙	Spec resilience policy — circuit breaker, retry, graceful degradation when Google is unavailable (on-prem with no internet must not break)
	∙	Define GoogleIntegration database schema (google_integration.*) and initial migration (token storage)

	∙	Spec what can be imported: lesson plans, assessments, diary templates — from CSV, DOCX, PDF, or Google Drive
	∙	Spec what can be exported: the same, plus results/reports as CSV or PDF
	∙	Spec orchestration flow — ImportExport is the most complex integration surface; map its event dependencies on FileProcessing, GoogleIntegration, and ObjectStorage explicitly
	∙	Spec commands: StartImport, StartExport, CancelJob
	∙	Spec published events: ImportCompletedEvent, ImportFailedEvent, ExportReadyEvent
	∙	Spec async job pattern — all import/export jobs use 202 Accepted + SignalR push for progress

Phase 12 — Frontend infrastructure (can be parallelized with Phase 1–3)
	∙	Spec and implement apiFetch wrapper in lib/api/client.ts with token attachment, ProblemDetails error normalization, 401 silent refresh, 403 handling
	∙	Spec and implement tokenManager in lib/auth/ (in-memory access token, httpOnly refresh cookie, silent refresh lifecycle)
	∙	Spec and implement middleware.ts auth guard — protected vs public routes, Keycloak redirect
	∙	Spec and implement SignalRProvider and connectionManager.ts — hub lifecycle, reconnect, token refresh on reconnect, cache invalidation on reconnect
	∙	Spec and implement useAuthStore (Zustand) — current user identity, decoded JWT claims, auth status
	∙	Spec and implement useSignalRStore (Zustand) — connection status per hub
	∙	Spec and implement usePermissions() hook — reads claims from auth store, exposes permission check interface
	∙	Spec and implement useAsyncJob() hook — subscribes to JobStatusHub, returns status for a given jobId

	∙	Spec and implement PresentationViewer component — full-screen shell, keyboard nav, Framer Motion transitions, slide renderer
	∙	Spec MSW handler baseline — mirror every API endpoint as it’s specced, so frontend tests are never blocked by backend availability

Phase 13 — Observability & ops hardening
	∙	Spec custom business metrics per module — list every counter, histogram, and gauge each module should emit (follow module.{name}.{metric} convention)
	∙	Spec dead-letter queue health check — one per MassTransit consumer, surfaced as degraded health check
	∙	Spec module-level readiness checks — what each module checks in /readyz (its own DB schema, its own consumers)
	∙	Write backup.sh spec — pg_dump per-module schema coverage, Keycloak realm export, Seq volume, restore ordering
	∙	Write upgrade.sh spec — migration-first ordering, rollback abort condition, post-upgrade readiness check
	∙	Spec air-gapped install — docker save/load flow, offline Keycloak/Seq config, verification step
	∙	Write end-to-end install walkthrough (README-install.md spec) — what an institution operator sees from download to first login

Phase 14 — Integration and E2E tests
	∙	Write integration test baseline for each module: real Postgres via Testcontainers, MassTransit in-memory harness, WireMock for external HTTP
	∙	Write cross-module integration tests for the critical event chains: DiaryEntry submitted → Notification sent, Assessment published → Delivery session created, File uploaded → FileProcessing completed
	∙	Write ImportExport integration tests — the most complex orchestration surface; cover happy path and failure/retry paths
	∙	Write Playwright E2E smoke tests (optional but high value): login → create diary entry → submit → verify notification received
